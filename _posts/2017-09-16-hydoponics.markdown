An exploration into sustainable living with plants and technology.

This has been a journey of exploration with a desire to learn about plants and self sufficiency.  Hydroponics came into my sphere of influence because of the dramatic reduction in water required to grow crops.  This comes with it's caveats, but it can't be denied that hydroponics uses less water to grow a plant.
