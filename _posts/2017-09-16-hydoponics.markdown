An exploration into sustainable living with plants and technology.

This has been a journey of exploration with a desire to learn about plants and self sufficiency.  Hydroponics came into my sphere of influence because of the dramatic reduction in water required to grow crops.  This comes with it's caveats, but it can't be denied that hydroponics uses less water to grow a plant.

This is the beginning of the hydroponic operation.  A Raspberry Pi was built and setup to monitor the air temp / humidity, water temp / ph, and send IR signals to our AC plugs for turning the fans and pumps on/off.

Off to Hawaii to learn more about growing and sustainable living!  First stop, the middle of nowhere Maui, a perfect place to put my skills to the test.  No hydroponic setup required.

One of my favorite places to go.

Learned about so many different types of plants, and most importantly, watched them grow.

In the end, I learned how intricate our ecosystem is. If we work with nature then the rewards are bountiful.
